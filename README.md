1.12.2 forge minecraft client

made for pvp and killing noobs

on first run ensure your voices volume is maxed ;)

## Why

Got bored pt. 3, began work as a project for my friends to pvp, turned into this

## How

Download the latest release or build yourself, put file into your mods folder and run with forge

## Build

If you want to compile your own binaries use the following commands


```bash
./gradlew setupdecompworkspace
./gradlew build
```

## Usage

Right shift opens the GUI

'.' is the default prefix, to change this go to .minecraft\Wurstplus3\configs\default\BINDS.txt and change the top line
